Readme file for the IP4DI inversion.
 
Start matlab. Set the present working directory to the folder you extracted the files.

In both 2.5D and 3D case:
Type start to read a file and run an inversion.
Type forward_modeling to create a resistivity model and calculate the apparent resistivities.
Type inversion_results to process and display the output inversion file.
Type preprocessing to create the Active time constraind model.

Some demo files can be found inside the demodata subfolder.
