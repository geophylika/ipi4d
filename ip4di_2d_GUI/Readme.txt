Readme file for the IP4DI inversion.
Two foldels coresponds for the 2.5D and 3D inversion.
 
Start matlab. Set the present working directory to the folder you extracted the files.

In both 2.5D and 3D case:
Type start to read a file and run an inversion.
Type forward_modeling to create a resistivity model and calculate the apparent resistivities.
Type inversion_results to process and display the output inversion file.
Type preprocessing to create the Active time constraind model.

Some demo files can be found inside the demodata subfolder.
