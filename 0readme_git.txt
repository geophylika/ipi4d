This is a GIT repository with the IGI code,
created from version v1 of FL's developments.
In the future, this GIT repo should be created
again from MK's GIT repo, such as to include
original ip4di development history (even if
it's only 3 commits...).

Centralized 'reference' repo should be on DIAS' servers at
lavouef@atlas.cp.dias.ie:/home/lavouef/02_SIP/06_SIP_INVERSION/IP4DI_PKG/IP4DI_2D_IGI_no-GUI
