Thank you for using IP4DI. This readme explains the general structure
and use of the package.

- Folders 'ip4di_2d_GUI' and 'ip4di_3d_GUI' contain Marios Karaoulis'
version of the code, which makes use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

- Folder 'ip4di_2d_no-GUI_IGI' contains Francois Lavoue's version, which
includes Image-Guided Inversion (IGI) based on Jieyi Zhou's work, and
has been reshaped to be used without the GUI (no-GUI).

For details on the use of each version, please refer to the readme files
in each directory. For details on the conditions of use of this package,
