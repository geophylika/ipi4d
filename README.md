Simulation and inversion of DC or transient, time-lapse electrical data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for using IP4DI. This readme explains the general structure
and use of the package.

Folders 'ip4di_2d_GUI' and 'ip4di_3d_GUI' contain Marios Karaoulis' ver-
sion of the code, which makes use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Folder 'ip4di_2d_no-GUI_IGI' contains Francois Lavoue's version, which
includes Image-Guided Inversion (IGI) based on Jieyi Zhou's work, and
has been reshaped to be used without the GUI (no-GUI).

For details on the use of each version, please refer to the readme files
in each directory. For details on the conditions of use of this package,
please read the '0legal_statement.txt' file.

This package is maintained under Git version control and the 'master'
branch can be cloned from https://github.com/mariosgeo/ipi4d.

Please feel free to contact the authors for any question, comment or
suggestion.
