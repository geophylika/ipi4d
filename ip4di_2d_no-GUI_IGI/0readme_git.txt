This is a Git repository with the IGI code,
created from version v1 of FL's developments.

In the future, this Git repo might be integrated
into MK's IP4DI repo on GitHub, or just uploaded
on GitHub as a project within a group that would
include FL, MK, Andre Revil and eventually any
future user and/or developer of the code.

(waiting for MK's answer about this...)
